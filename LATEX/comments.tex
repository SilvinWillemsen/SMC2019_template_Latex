1) Reviewer 1 had no particular changes requested.

2) We accounted for reviewer's 3 useful suggestions of adding a contextualization of the developed technologies.

3) We clarified the mathematical formulations as requested by reviewer 2, by adding references as requested.

We also clarified the units, e.g. in
$F$ is in $m.s^{-2}$, $\omega_0$ is in $s^{-1}, but $\omega_1$ is in $m^{-1/2}.s^{-1/2}$ and $\sigma_{\times}$ is in $s^{-1}$
F is acceleration.
